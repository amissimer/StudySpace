# StudySpace
Developed a working prototype mobile application called StudySpaces for the 2024 SheInnovates Hackathon with Grace Hines and Sruthi Malineni.

We have all struggled to find open spaces to study across Pitt's campus, making it one of the most frustrating parts of being a student. We believe this app would help make the process of finding a study space more streamlined and easy.

The app enables you to see what time(s) rooms in buildings across the campus are open for students to use to study and lets you select a time to reserve.
